# deno-chat

This is a simple chat application built using [Deno](http://deno.land/) and
deployed to [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).

This was originally based on code from Jack Herrington's [Deno Deploy Architecture Speedrun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZDvE0mP4Y4), but that is now outdated, so this repo contains code that's fixed and working as of Deno 1.21 and Deno Deploy beta 3.

I'll leave this repo here and fork it to make my own variant.

## Tech stack

- [Deno](http://deno.land/): A modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy): A distributed system that runs
  JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly at the edge, worldwide.
- [oak](https://oakserver.github.io/oak/): A middleware framework for Denoâ€™s
  native HTTP server, inspired by [Koa](https://koajs.com/).
- [fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/): A web framework built on top of [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) that lets you build projects very fast, highly dynamic, and without the need of a build step.

## Getting started 

To deploy this to Deno Deploy:

1. Create a project for the API and link it to `deno-chat-api/index.js`.
2. Grab the API URL and change it in `deno-chat-client/islands/Chat.tsx`.
3. Create a project for the client and link it to `deno-chat-client/main.ts`.

## Demo

This should be live at [aalaap-deno-chat-client.deno.dev](https://aalaap-deno-chat-client.deno.dev) and the API should be running at [aalaap-deno.chat-api.deno.dev](https://aalaap-deno.chat-api.deno.dev).
